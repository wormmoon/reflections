//What happens when you initialize a repository? Why do 
you need to do it?

When you initialise a repository on Git, it creates the
file in which the metadata on the commits you've made is
stored when you do start making commits. A commit is not
automatically made. Without doing so you cannot make 
commits. You can save your files, but you will not be able
to look at older versions of the saves through Git.
