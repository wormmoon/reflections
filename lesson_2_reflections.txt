//What happens when you initialize a repository? Why do 
you need to do it?

When you initialise a repository on Git, it creates the
file in which the metadata on the commits you've made is
stored when you do start making commits. A commit is not
automatically made. Without doing so you cannot make 
commits. You can save your files, but you will not be able
to look at older versions of the saves through Git.

//How is the staging area different from the working 
directory and the repository? What value do you think it 
offers?

The staging area allows you to add and remove files before 
creating a commit with them. This has the advantage of 
being able to decide the best time to make a commit? And if
you change your mind you can change it before actually
having made the commit. I suppose you might realise 
there's something else you need to add that's also within
that logical step, so you might want to add another file or
something?
