//When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?

When you're collaborating with others on projects, or when 
you may need
to be able to reach and edit a project from different 
computers. 

//Why might you want to always pull changes manually 
rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with 
your remote repository?

Just in case you've maybe made a change locally that 
conflicts with a change someone else working on the 
project might have made. This is all I can think of
for now!
