//When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?

When you're collaborating with others on projects, or when 
you may need
to be able to reach and edit a project from different 
computers. 

//Why might you want to always pull changes manually 
rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with 
your remote repository?

Just in case you've maybe made a change locally that 
conflicts with a change someone else working on the 
project might have made. This is all I can think of
for now!

//Describe the differences between forks, clones, and 
branches. When would you use one instead of another?

Forks: Repositories shared from one GitHub account to
another (all on GitHub servers). Forks are used when 
you want to use someone else's project within GitHub.
It is a public sharing of the files, and as such is able
to be seen by others as 'forked' from the original.

Clones: Repositories shared from a local computer to GitHub
or vice versa. Cloning allows you to push or pull 
repositories from and to you or someone elses computer. 
Used for example if you want to save your rep. from your
computer to GitHub or vice versa. 

Branches: Added to repositories, to allow you to test out
features, or to make a (usually finalised) part of your
project public on GitHub/share it, while keeping other non
finalised parts private on your computer
